                        In Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, a Mid-term progress presentation workshop on determining intrinsic vulnerability and state of groundwater to contamination Awash River basin was presented to concerned authorities.The study team comprised
                        scholars of various fields of studies from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University & Addis Ababa University. The project will be completed in two years and will run from January 2020 to October 2022, according to the project
                        coordinator Dr.Behailu Berhanu.At the conference, the research team presented to the audience the Geological, Hydrological, Data, and Methodology of the study they have achieved so far. Accordingly, participants of the workshop
                        raised different questions, suggestions, and discussions which have a lot of input on the proposed study progress. Finally, the participants reminded the study group that since Awash river basin has a large number of water beneficiaries
                        and areas of development, the ongoing project should be focused on the challenges and being part of the solution.
