							<h2> AASTU Graduation day</h2> The annual graduation ceremony at most universities is a day devoted to celebrating an important point in students' lives. Examinations are finally over, scruffiness is replaced with fancy clothes and parents admire their children for reaching the finishing line of a long marathon. Most of all, it is a time of unrestrained optimism. I recently attended a graduation ceremony and although I shared the students' joy, I had some sobering thoughts. As I looked at all the smiling faces, I wondered what the future will hold for these students and what established scientists can and should do to help them.
