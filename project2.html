							<h2>Mid-term progress presentation workshop held on determining intrinsic vulnerability and state of groundwater to contamination Awash River Basin </h2>In Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, a Mid-term progress presentation workshop on determining intrinsic vulnerability and state of groundwater to contamination Awash River basin was presented to concerned authorities.The study team comprised scholars of various fields of studies from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University & Addis Ababa University.4
							The project will be completed in two years and will run from January 2020 to October 2022, according to the project coordinator Dr.Behailu Berhanu.At the conference, the research team presented to the audience the Geological, Hydrological, Data, and Methodology of the study they have achieved so far. Accordingly, participants of the workshop raised different questions, suggestions, and discussions which have a lot of input on the proposed study progress. Finally, the participants reminded the study group that since Awash river basin has a large number of water beneficiaries and areas of development, the ongoing project should be focused on the challenges and being part of the solution.</td>

							<h2> AASTU Graduation day</h2> The annual graduation ceremony at most universities is a day devoted to celebrating an important point in students' lives. Examinations are finally over, scruffiness is replaced with fancy clothes and parents admire their children for reaching the finishing line of a long marathon. Most of all, it is a time of unrestrained optimism. I recently attended a graduation ceremony and although I shared the students' joy, I had some sobering thoughts. As I looked at all the smiling faces, I wondered what the future will hold for these students and what established scientists can and should do to help them.
